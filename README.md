# Care-Centered Value Sensitive Design (CCVSD) Guidebook

This interactive digital guidebook translates the theoretical framework of **Care-Centered Value Sensitive Design (CCVSD)** into a practical, actionable tool for roboticists, designers, and healthcare engineers.

It bridges the gap between abstract care ethics and concrete technical implementations, helping development teams align robotic behavior with the nuanced moral landscape of care environments.

## 📖 Thesis

This project serves as the digital artifact and practical companion to the Master's Thesis:
